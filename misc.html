      <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
      <p id="topmisc">This page is dedicated to all the single projects I have completed, such as one-off school projects that cannot take up an entire page.  It also contains drawings in addition to digital work.</p>
      <div id="other-content">
        <div>
          <img src="img/misc/cubes.png" alt="Cubes">
          <h2>Cubes</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">This is something I drew on my own time. I enjoy creating shapes and giving them a three-dimensional pop out feel.  I started with one cube, then drew all the other cubes around it as if they were growing out of it like a tree.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="img/misc/greetings-from-nyc-postcard.png" alt="Postcard">
          <h2>Old Poster</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">For this assignment, we were asked to make an old-style postcard from any city of our choice.  We were asked to use old photos to create the combination.  New York City is my favorite city, so I wanted to a make a representation of that with two cool photographs I found online.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="img/misc/smoking-man.svg" alt="Smoking Man">
          <h2>Smoking Man</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">I created this on scratchboard paper and designed the entire artwork in pointillism.  I designed it after a photo that I found in an artbook.  I picked it because of the way the smoke ran accros the man's face.  I really liked the effect and I wanted to recreate it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="img/misc/me.png" alt="Me">
          <h2>Me</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">For this assignment, we were asked to take a picture of ourselves, in front of a green screen. We did this so that we could focus on just us and not get caught up in the background.  The green screen made it easier to make the background blank when we filled it in. Then, we created an illustration on top of the photo.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
         <img src="img/misc/chair.png" alt="chair">
        <h2>Chair</h2>
        <p class="miscinfo">I created this artwork in pen and also designed it in pointillism.  I designed it based on a photograph I found in a artbook. I picked the photo because I really liked how the bricks and chair looked.  The whole scene was serene and had an old timey feel to it, and it was something I thought would be fun to recreate.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="img/misc/amped_snowboard.png" alt="Amped Snowboard">
            <h2>Amped Snowboard Design</h2>
            <p class="miscinfo">I created a fake snowboard company name.  Then I designed the top and bottom of a snowboard.  The top part of the snowboard is where the bindings get screwed in.  The design was a recreation of an old unfinished abstract drawing that I did.  I positioned the drawing horizontally for the top and vertically for the bottom.  The logo is something that I sketched then recreated in the computer. I used the word <q>Amped</q> because I thought it perfectly described the feeling of being on a board.

          <div>
          <img src="img/misc/weed-poster-portfolio.png" alt="THC Poster">
          <h2>THC Poster</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">For this project, we were asked to watch a video in class on three different subjects.  The video was called Botany of Desire.  The video went into the history of tulips and apples.  The final subject matter was THC and how it affects certain parts of the brain, the positives and negatives.  Then we were asked to take any of the subject matter from the video and make an informative poster.  I decided to highlight different parts of the brain to show how THC affects the three main sections the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and the cerebellum, while also showcasing what their overall function is.</p>

            <img src="img/misc/spiderman_drawing.png" alt="Drawing of Spiderman">
            <h2>Pen Drawing of Spiderman</h2>
            <p class="miscinfo">This is a drawing I did in High School, and it was first sketched then I touched it up with colored pens. Spiderman is my favorite superhero and I really enjoy drawing him, this is one of many spiderman drawings. I created the design from a folder that I had and used it for visual reference.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
          <img src="img/misc/death_invitation.png" alt="Death Invitation">
          <h2>Death Party Invitation</h2>
          <p class="miscinfo">This is an invitation that I designed, for a surprise 30th birthday party for my fiancé.  I designed it as a funeral invitation but a funeral for his 20’s and his youth. I wanted to make it fun but minimalistic, so I tried not to overcrowd it with too much information or graphics.</p>
